# The regression to the mean phenomenon in cross-sectional biological age prediction

This repo contains a brief [explainer](Explainer.md) of the regression to the mean phenomenon and its relevance to biological age prediction. It includes a simple simulated example to illustrate the problems that arise when directly comparing the biological ages of different groups defined by their chronological age (e.g., individuals from the general population and extremely long-lived individuals).
